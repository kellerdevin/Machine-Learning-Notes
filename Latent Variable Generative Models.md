Latent variable [[Generative Models]] , on the other hand, are models that generate data by sampling from a learned distribution over a set of latent variables. These models typically learn to model the joint probability distribution of the input data and the latent variables. During inference, the model can be used to generate new samples by sampling from the learned distribution over the latent variables and then generating the corresponding output data. Examples of latent variable models include the variational autoencoder (VAE) and the generative adversarial network (GAN).
