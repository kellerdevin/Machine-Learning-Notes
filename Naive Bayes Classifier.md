Naive Bayes Classifier is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, such as determining whether an email is spam or not.

Naive Bayes Classifier is built on the [[Naive Bayes]] algorithm

To train a Naive Bayes Classifier, we need a labeled dataset where the input features and corresponding class labels are known. The algorithm learns to estimate the conditional probability of each feature given each class label, as well as the prior probability of each class label in the dataset.

Once the model is trained, we can use it to predict the class label of new input data. The algorithm calculates the posterior probability of each class label given the input features and selects the label with the highest probability as the prediction.

Overall, Naive Bayes Classifier is a simple and effective algorithm that can work well for certain types of classification problems, particularly when there are many features and the data is relatively sparse.
