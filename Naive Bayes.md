Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm used in machine learning for [[Supervised Learning]] classification tasks. it is also a type of  [[Generative Models]]  that estimates the probability distribution of the features and the target variable to make predictions. It's called "naive" because it assumes that the features (i.e., attributes or variables) are independent of each other, which may not always be true in the real world.

The algorithm works by calculating the probability of each class label (e.g., spam or not spam) given a set of input features (e.g., email text). It does this by using Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of a hypothesis (e.g., a particular class label) given some observed evidence (e.g., the input features) is proportional to the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis.

In practice, Naive Bayes works by first training a model on a labeled dataset, where the input features and corresponding class labels are known. The model learns to estimate the conditional probability of each feature given each class label, as well as the prior probability of each class label in the dataset. Then, when given a new set of input features, the model calculates the posterior probability of each class label given the input features and selects the label with the highest probability as the prediction.

Overall, Naive Bayes is a simple and efficient algorithm that can work well for certain types of classification problems, particularly when there are many features and the data is relatively sparse.
