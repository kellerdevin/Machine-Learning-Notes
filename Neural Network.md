A neural network consists of layers of nodes, each of which performs a simple mathematical operation on its input and passes the result to the next layer.

Each connection between nodes has a weight, which determines the strength of the connection between those nodes.

Biases are an additional parameter associated with each node that is used to shift the output of that node.

While a typical neural network has an input, hidden, and output layer, some networks have additional layers or different arrangements of layers.

Math:

The "simple mathematical operation" performed by each node in a neural network is typically a linear transformation followed by a nonlinear activation function.

The linear transformation involves multiplying the input values by their corresponding weights and summing them together. The result is then added to a bias term associated with that node. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

z = w1_x1 + w2_x2 + ... + wn*xn + b

The nonlinear activation function is then applied to the activation value to introduce nonlinearity into the network. Common activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU (rectified linear unit), and tanh. These functions allow the network to model complex, nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs.

Optimization Algorithms:

[[Backpropagation]] is an algorithm for computing the gradients of the weights and biases in a neural network with respect to a loss function, which measures how well the network is performing. The gradients can be used to update the weights and biases to improve the network's performance on a particular task.

How to stop [[Overfitting]]:

One way to detect overfitting is to use a validation dataset, which is a separate dataset used to evaluate the model's performance during training. If the validation accuracy starts to decrease while the training accuracy continues to increase, it may indicate that the model is overfitting.

To prevent overfitting, several techniques can be used, such as early stopping, where we stop training the model once the validation accuracy stops improving, or regularization, which adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage the weights from becoming too large. Dropout is another popular technique where randomly selected neurons are dropped out or deactivated during training, which helps the model generalize better to new data.

Other Types of Nerual Networks:

[[Convolutional Nerual Network]] are designed for image data, where the connections between nodes are structured to take advantage of the spatial relationships between adjacent pixels.

[[Recurrent Neural Networks]] are designed for sequences of data, where the output at each time step depends on the previous outputs.
