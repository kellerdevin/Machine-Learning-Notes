Non-parametric generative models, on the other hand, do not make any assumptions about the functional form of the probability distribution they are trying to estimate. These models typically have an infinite number of parameters that grow with the size of the training data. Examples of non-parametric generative models include the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) and the Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM).
