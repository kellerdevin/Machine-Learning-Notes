Likelihood-based [[Generative Models]] are models that estimate the probability distribution of the input data directly. These models typically use [[Maximum Likelihood Estimation]] to estimate the parameters of the distribution. Examples of likelihood-based generative models include the autoencoder (AE) and the variational autoencoder (VAE).
