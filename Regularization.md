**Lasso Regression**
L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression): L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficient. This can result in some coefficient to become zero, effectively excluding them from the model. This is useful for feature selection

**Ridge Regression**
L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. This type of regularization doesn't necessarily exclude variables from the model but reduces their impact

**Elastic Net Regularization**
Elastic Net is a combination of L1 and L2 regularization. It adds both penalities and can be useful when there are multiple correlated features

As for Elastic Net, it combines the strengths of both L1 and L2 regularization. In scenarios where we have several correlated predictors, L1 regularization might randomly select one predictor as its "favorite" and reduce the coefficients of the rest to zero. On the other hand, L2 would distribute the weight among them.

Elastic Net combines these approaches - it effectively shrinks coefficients (like L2) while enforcing sparsity (like L1), allowing for the retention of correlated variables by grouping them together. This makes Elastic Net a preferred choice when dealing with datasets with multiple features that are correlated.
