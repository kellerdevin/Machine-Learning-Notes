Unsupervised learning is used when we have unlabeled data, which means that we don't know the correct output for each input example. Instead, the [[Neural Network]]  learns to find patterns or structure in the data by clustering similar examples together or by finding common factors that explain the variation in the data. The goal is to learn a representation of the data that captures its underlying structure, which can then be used for other tasks like visualization or classification.
