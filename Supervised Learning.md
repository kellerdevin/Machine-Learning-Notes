Supervised learning is used when we have labeled data, which means that we know the correct output for each input example. During training, the neural network learns to map inputs to outputs by adjusting its weights and biases to minimize the difference between its predicted output and the correct output. The goal is to learn a function that can accurately predict the output for new, unseen inputs.
