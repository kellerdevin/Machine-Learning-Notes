A regular neural network would struggle with image recognition tasks because it would not be able to capture the spatial information in the image. This is where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) come in.

A CNN is a type of [[Neural Network]] that is specifically designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. It consists of multiple layers of filters, also called convolutional layers, that apply small kernel filters to the input image to detect local features and patterns.

The filter is a small matrix that is convolved with the image to produce a feature map, which is a representation of the input image that highlights certain features. The convolution operation is repeated across the image by sliding the filter over the image with a specified stride, which is the distance by which the filter is shifted at each step.

The output of the convolutional layer is then passed through a nonlinear activation function, such as ReLU, which introduces nonlinearity into the network. 

This is followed by a pooling layer, which reduces the dimensionality of the feature map by taking the maximum or average value in a small region of the feature map.

This process of convolution and pooling is repeated multiple times to extract increasingly complex features from the input image. The final output of the CNN is then fed into a fully connected layer, which performs a classification task, such as identifying the object in the image.

In summary, CNNs are used for image recognition tasks because they are able to capture the spatial relationships between pixels in an image by using convolutional layers and pooling layers to extract features. This makes them particularly well-suited for tasks such as object recognition, facial recognition, and image segmentation.
