  
Transfer learning is a technique in machine learning where a pre-trained [[Neural Network]], typically trained on a large dataset, is used as a starting point for a new task that is related in some way to the original task.

The pre-trained model has already learned some feature representations that are useful for the new task, and these representations can be fine-tuned on a smaller dataset for the new task. The goal of transfer learning is to leverage the knowledge learned from the original task to improve the performance of the model on the new task.

For example, let's say you want to train a model to classify different species of cats. Instead of training the model from scratch on a large dataset of cat images, you could start with a pre-trained neural network that has been trained on a large dataset of images, such as ImageNet. The pre-trained model has already learned to recognize many common features in images, such as edges, corners, and textures, that are useful for a wide range of tasks.

You can then fine-tune the pre-trained model on your smaller dataset of cat images by adding a few new layers that are specific to the cat classification task. By doing this, you can use the pre-trained model's learned feature representations as a starting point and then fine-tune them for the cat classification task. This can save a lot of time and computational resources compared to training a model from scratch on a small dataset.

In summary, transfer learning is a technique in machine learning where a pre-trained neural network model is used as a starting point for a new task, and the learned feature representations are fine-tuned for the new task. Transfer learning can save time and computational resources and improve the performance of the model on the new task.
