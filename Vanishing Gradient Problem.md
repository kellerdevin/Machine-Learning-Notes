The vanishing gradient problem is a common issue in deep learning neural networks where the gradients (slopes) of the loss function with respect to the network's parameters become very small during backpropagation. This makes it difficult to update the parameters of early layers in the network because the updates are proportional to the gradient, and very small gradients result in very small updates. This can cause the early layers to learn very slowly or not at all, leading to poor performance of the network. The opposite of this problem, when gradients become very large during training, is known as the exploding gradient problem.

Essentially, when the gradients that are backpropagated through the network during training become very small, the weights in the earlier layers of the network can't be updated effectively, which can cause the network to learn poorly.
